2.5D Platformer Test Project

Things to Implement:
	Character Select Menu:
	A bunch of art assets
	Ability System: (40%?)
	Rooms: (20%?)
		Camera bound in the same room as player
		Camera only shows the current room
		Transition between rooms
			Fade in fade out animation?
		Need to create rooms for the different room types
		Need to figure out a basic 1x1 room size
		Need to create a mini map room for different sized rooms
		Need to make a controller for the map screen

	Procedural Level Generation:
		Need to figure out how to handle different room sizes and multiple exits in the same
		direction.

		Spawning after level was created

	Controller Support for UI:

	Key Rebinding:

	Enemy AI:(10%?)
		Enemies need to awake when the player enters the room and sleep when out of the room
		Boss AIs
		Enemy AIs: Currently have 3 basic AI patterns
			Ground:
				Walking
				Pacing
				Jumping
			Flying:
				Medusa style
			Traps:
				Falling Trap


Things to Research:
	Controller Support for the UI
	Key Rebinding
	Better Level generation
	Audio System
	Game Manager System
	Saving the current game
	Loading previous games


Bugs/Unintended Behaviours:
	Wall sliding down slopes looks weird at certain angles

	Getting audio errors even though the audio source is on the Game Manager game object
