2.5D Platformer Test Project

Things to Implement:
	Character Select Menu:

	Ability System: (60%?)

	Audio System
	Game Manager System
		User Preferences
	Saving the current game
	Loading previous games
	Water Physics


Bugs/Unintended Behaviours:
	Can go through moving platforms if the platform moves through a climable object.
	Damage numbers are sometimes hard to read
	Lighting is being weird
	Treadmills and moving platforms need to have no rotation.
	

Code that needs commenting/better comments:
	1 GameManager
